        This project implements basic wallet functionality to manage Stellar test accounts. 
        Access to the wallet is secured by Google Authentication. It is highly recommended that you enable 
        two factor authentication for the Google account used with this application.
    </p>

    <p class="splash-text">
        Basic wallet functionality includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li class="splash-text"><b><u>create</u></b>&nbsp;Create a test account using the Stellar Friendbot and an accompanying passphrase.</li>
        <li class="splash-text"><b><u>import</u></b>&nbsp;Import an existing test account into the wallet using a passphrase and the account's secret seed. The secret seed is encrypted and stored on a secure cloud server.</li>
        <li class="splash-text"><b><u>balances</u></b>&nbsp;Query account balances for a Stellar test account.</li>
        <li class="splash-text"><b><u>transfer</u></b>&nbsp;Transfer funds (in lumens) between 2 test accounts. The passphrase is needed to perform this operation.</li>
        <li class="splash-text"><b><u>transactions</u></b>&nbsp;Query account transactions for a Stellar test account.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="splash-text">
        Account keys, pubic key and secret seed, are hashed or encrypted to eliminate exposure. Keys are stored in the cloud and never stored store locally on the end user's computer. 
        The create, import, and transfer functions are further secured by a user chosen passphrase. The balance and transaction query functions are public within the Stellar network so no passphrase is needed.
